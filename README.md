IPL Analysis Dashboard (2008-2020)

Project Overview
This project is an in-depth analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) from 2008 to 2020. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of the tournament such as the Title Winner, Orange Cap, Purple Cap, and Toss Decision Analysis. The analysis was performed using Tableau and is based on two datasets:

Match Information Dataset (2008-2020): Contains details about each match played during the IPL seasons.
Ball-by-Ball Dataset: Provides detailed information about each ball bowled during all IPL matches.
Key Features of the Dashboard:
Title Winner: Displays the IPL champions.
Orange Cap: Highlights the leading run-scorer of the tournament (Virat Kohli with 5,878 runs).
Purple Cap: Shows the leading wicket-taker (Lasith Malinga with 170 wickets).
Tournament 6's and 4's: Shows the total number of sixes and fours hit during the IPL seasons.
Toss Decision Winning Percentage: Pie chart displaying win percentage based on toss decisions (Bat vs Field).
Matches Won Based on Toss: Bar chart illustrating team-wise matches won based on toss decisions.
Batsman and Bowler Statistics: Detailed stats on top-performing batsmen and bowlers across all seasons.
Datasets Used
Match Information Dataset (2008-2020):

Contains information such as match ID, season, date, venue, teams, toss winner, toss decision, match winner, and player of the match.
Ball-by-Ball Dataset:

Contains ball-by-ball details of every match, including the batsman, bowler, runs scored, extras, wickets, and more.
Both datasets were cleaned and preprocessed before visualization.

Mumbai Indians emerged as the most successful IPL franchise.
Virat Kohli is the leading run-scorer, and Lasith Malinga is the leading wicket-taker.
Teams that chose to field after winning the toss have a higher win percentage.
The dashboard allows filtering by season to explore specific years in detail.
